### Tasking Manager: Optimize API Performance

Project Description: Tasking Manager (TM) is a tool for collaborative editing on [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/).
Our current version of the tool - TM V3 is hosted on http://tasks.hotosm.org/. We're currently in the midst of Version 4 release which involves a significant ugrade to the frontend framework - porting from Angular JS to React JS framework.
As a next step our focus is to identify, understand and optimise TM's backend performance.

You will work alongside our tech team and be exposed to:

* Our codebase in Flask microframework
* PostgreSQL Database
* Debugging
* Profiling existing endpoints for CPU performance and memory footprint
* Rest API best practices 
* An active Open Source geospatial community

 
**Skills**: Python, DBMS, Documentation, Curiosity :cat: and lots of perseverance :trophy: <br>

### Slackbot Router

Project Description: Slack is central to all our commincations within and outside the oeganisations. This project involves creating a simple routing app that will be triggered when someone runs a slack command and return the right results based on the command.

We could have slackbot mapped to slack commands for the following use cases:

* to know if a HOT application is operational
* provide user and project statistics on a specifc HOT Project
* provide suspicious changeset summary for HOT Projects on TM

Through this project you will learn about:
* slack APIs and dealing with JSON payloads
* setting up your code on AWS Lambda

**Skills**: Javascript(NodeJS), AWS Lambda

**Difficulty Level**: Medium
