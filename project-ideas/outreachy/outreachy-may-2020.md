#### Tasking Manager: Optimize API Performance

Project Description: Tasking Manager (TM) is a tool for collaborative editing on [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/).
Our current version of the tool - TM V3 is hosted on http://tasks.hotosm.org/. We're currently in the midst of Version 4 release
which involves a significant ugrade to the frontend framework - porting from Angular JS to React JS framework.
As a next step our focus is to identify, understand and optimise TM's backend performance

The project will provide exposure to:

* Our codebase in Flask microframework
* PostgreSQL Database
* Debugging
* Profiling existing endpoints for CPU performance and memory footprint
* Rest API best practices 
* An active Open Source geospatial community

 
**Skills**: Python, DBMS, Documentation, Curiosity :cat: and lots of perseverance :trophy: <br>
