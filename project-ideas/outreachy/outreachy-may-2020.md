which involves a significant ugrade to the frontend framework - porting from Angular JS to React JS framework.
As a next step our focus is to identify, understand and optimise TM's backend performance

The project will provide exposure to:

* PostgreSQL Database
* Debugging
* Profiling existing endpoints for cpu performance and memory footprint
* Rest API best practices 
* An active Open Source geospatial community
